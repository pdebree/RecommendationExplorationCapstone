This subset includes the data from the Million Songs Dataset but matched with MIDI files for each track. (Audio files were obtained by reaching out to the owner). This dataset was combined with [The Echo Nest Taste Profile Subset](http://millionsongdataset.com/tasteprofile/), from the Million Songs Dataset in order to create a subset of Audio matched songs that have user taste information. This will allow us to create the recommendation system based on these user's tastes. \n",

This calls mmsongsdb_to_csv.py which creates a `.csv` by iterating all of the h5 files in the `lmd_matched_h5` dataset.
